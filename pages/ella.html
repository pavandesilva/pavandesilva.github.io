        <h1>Ella</h1>
        <p>Ella is a small town in the Badulla District of Uva Province, Sri Lanka governed by an Urban Council. It is approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) east of Colombo and is situated at an elevation of 1,041 metres (3,415 ft) above sea level. The area
            has a rich bio-diversity, dense with numerous varieties of flora and fauna. Ella is surrounded by hills covered with cloud forests and tea plantations. The town has a cooler climate than the surrounding lowlands, due to its elevation. The
            Ella Gap allows views across the southern plains of Sri Lanka. Nine Arches Bridge, Ella Rock, (a lookout point), Diyaluma Falls, a 220 m (720 ft) waterfall, Yahalamadiththa temple and Little Adam's Peak are some popular attractions in the
            area.
